Where she has a community where every LGBTQ+ feels safe to discuss stuff like this. But also to give inspiration for you or a friend you know?\n\n Go with me Miku, Elise and your other vocaloids vriends on a musical journey. We are going through the years and tell you what lead up to elise her trans choices. Heck even with her powers she often visits sekais and sings with those persons. As said Elise her idea for EGS is as follows.\n\n Each upload in the EGS video series will be a song with a story attached to it. You can find this in the description of the video. Elise usaully sings a diva song along side it. This can be alone, with me, me and rin, Heck even Leo/Need or Wonderland X Showtime.
